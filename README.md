## ✨ Features

* **One-Click Gallery Downloads:** Instantly fetch and save every image in a swipeable Reddit gallery.
* **Smart File Naming:** Automatically names and numbers files sequentially using the original post title (e.g., `Comic Title (01).png`, `Comic Title (02).png`) so your galleries stay in perfect reading order.
* **Context-Aware Button:** The download button dynamically changes its text and icon based on what you are scrolling past (Image, Gallery, or Text Post).
* **Text Post Extraction:** If a post contains body text, the extension automatically generates a cleanly formatted `.txt` file containing the title, author, URL, and post body.
* **Lightning Fast:** Powered by Manifest V3. The extension safely fetches the underlying JSON data of the post to grab the highest resolution media available.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
* **Native Reddit Videos:** To ensure a high-quality user experience, this extension intentionally skips native Reddit videos (`v.redd.it`). Reddit stores video and audio tracks on completely separate servers, meaning downloaded videos would be muted. The extension focuses strictly on delivering flawless picture, GIF, and text downloads.
