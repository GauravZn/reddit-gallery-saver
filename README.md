# Reddit Picture Gallery Downloader

A lightweight, frictionless Chrome Extension that allows you to download high-resolution images, multi-image galleries, and text posts directly from Reddit with a single click. 

No sketchy third-party websites, no copied links, and no annoying pop-up ads. Everything happens locally on your machine.

## ✨ Features

* **One-Click Gallery Downloads:** Instantly fetch and save every high-res image in a swipeable Reddit gallery.
* **Smart File Naming:** Automatically names and numbers files sequentially using the original post title (e.g., `Comic Title (01).png`, `Comic Title (02).png`) so your galleries stay in perfect reading order.
* **Context-Aware Button:** A clean, native-feeling button that intelligently adapts to the post.
* **Lightning Fast & Privacy First:** Powered by Manifest V3. The extension safely fetches the underlying JSON data of the post to grab the highest resolution media available entirely locally.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
* **Native Reddit Videos:** To ensure a high-quality user experience, this extension intentionally skips native Reddit videos (`v.redd.it`). Reddit stores video and audio tracks on completely separate servers, meaning downloaded videos would be muted. The extension focuses strictly on delivering flawless picture, GIF, and text downloads.
